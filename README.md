# Advent of Code 2023

This year, I'm trying out [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## Running
First, install dependencies with `bun install`

Each solutions is in its own file, organised by day and task
```
day01
  ↳ task1.ts
  ↳ task2.ts
day02
  ↳ task1.ts
  ↳ task2.ts
```

To run the solutions, add an `input.txt` file that contains your puzzle input into the matching day  
folder, then run `bun run dayX/taskY.ts`
